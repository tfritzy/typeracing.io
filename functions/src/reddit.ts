  'All I can think to say is "Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English: "Today you.... tomorrow me."',

  "This is where it all became clear. It was by some incredible fluke that his family hadn't been wiped off the face of the Earth years ago. Odds are his entire heritage was based on blind luck and some type of sick divine intervention that saves his family every time a threat presents itself. Kevin was the genetic pinnacle of this null achievement.",

  "You mentioned that you have a very unusual narrow bedroom with no windows; is there a chance that you are not getting enough ventilation when you sleep, or that there is a carbon monoxide leak in the building ? A cheap CO detector (which you should have anyway) is a fast way to find out. You'll also have really bad headaches.",

  "Finally the father said I should \"Get the fuck out of his house\" and I said it was irrational to treat me like this just because I never heard of a potato before. Well let me tell you he didn't take that kindly. Now in text messages I have been telling my girlfriend I really don't know what a potato is. The only way I can ever get out of this is for them to buy that I don't know what a potato is.",

  "Enter, Mr Streetlamp, is he wearing a Sesame Street shirt? No. He's wearing a shirt, tie too - he looks at the teacher and says 'Yes Miss?' - classy. The whole class is looking at him now, admiring his fashion sense, his awesome name, his doubley good name.

  "Nacho cheese doritos with rice: 7/10. Cool ranch doritos rice: 7/10. These are both really tasty but would make you think what is wrong with your life.",

  "So this one had to be cooked for various reasons. I boiled the rice and the ice, and I was left with rice. 10/10",

  "He took it out, and put it back into his mouth and bit it. Only...it wasn't the Jolly Rancher.",

  "Risotto seems difficult, but it's actually pretty damn easy. Just butter a pot, dice up a shallot, add a cup of arborio rice, then add chicken broth and stir for about 20 minutes. Be sure to add broth if need be, and don't forget to stir. I once left the risotto alone for 10 minutes and it burned the hell out of the rice, then my dad made me stand outside in the freezing cold while he beat me senseless with a set of jumper cables. After that, mix in some parmesan cheese and you've got risotto. Pretty simple.",

  "Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.",
